# IRC Chat Relay

A seamless real-time communication chat app enabling users to create an account, log in, and join multiple rooms to start chatting with others. Users can utilize various commands:
- ```/msg <username>``` to send a private message to another user in the same room.
- ```/join <room name>```  to join or create a new chat room.
- ```/quit <room name>``` to leave a chat room (if no room name is provided, it will exit the current room).
- ```/nick <new username>``` to change your username to a new one.
